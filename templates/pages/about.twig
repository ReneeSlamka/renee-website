                    <p>Before you ask, no, I'm not French.</p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a longtime Vancouverite, and currently in the final year of my
                        Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Software Engineering at the
                        University of British Columbia. I have yet to jump on the yoga bandwagon,
                        but I must admit I love this city (and its abundance of cheap sushi).

                            In the past year and half, I have spent much of my time working on front end
                            projects, both for co-op and school. While I was interning at the Dun and Bradstreet Cloud
                            Innovation Center, I got the chance to work with ReactJS to create data visualization
                            components. For my next work term at Dynamic Leap, I was tasked with rebuilding the
                            company's website using PHP, Twig and Boostrap. I liked it so much I decided to build my
                            own website.

                            I recently completed a course in relational databases, where we learned how to design
                            databases to model real life scenarios. We covered everything from creating Entity-Relationship
                            diagrams to translating those same diagrams into a working database. We also learned SQL, and
                            had to complete a project that incorporated certain complex queries.

                            I've been working with Git for several years, both at school and while on co-op. It wasn't
                            easy to get used to at first, but now I can't imagine life without source control. I use
                            a combo of the terminal and SourceTree to handled my "git needs", as I prefer using a
                            GUI for some tasks.

                            During my last co-op term, I worked on a Spring Boot practice project in order to become
                            more familiar with the framework. The majority of the project focused on back end development,
                            and I implemented features such as account creation, session management, and sharing text content
                            between users. I completed a similar type of project for a recent course on databases, and
                            was responsible for implementing account creation and login functionality on the backend.

                            design strategies. Since then I have had several opportunities to practice what I learned
                            in the form of school projects and personal projects, this website being one of them. I
                            always aim to abide by the "KISS" principle, "Keep It Simple, Stupid".

                            During the second year of my program, there was a heavy focus on embedded systems and
                            firmware development. The majority of our labs comprised of designing state machines and
                            implementing them using VHDL or Assembly on our DE2 logic boards. We also two term projects
                            that involved developing our own hardware and programming it; the first was a reflow oven
                            controller, and the second was a miniature motorized car that was controlled by the strength
                            of an electromagentic signal from a remote.<br>
                            This past summer I spent some time working with the Beagle Bone Black to assess its chip's
